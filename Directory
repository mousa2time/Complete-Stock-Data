    # Purpose
    purpose = """
    The purpose of this project is to analyze stock price data for the FAANG companies:
    Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. This data provides valuable insights
    into the stock market performance of these major technology companies over a specified 
    period of time. By analyzing this dataset, we can uncover trends, fluctuations, and 
    correlations in the stock prices of these companies.
    """

    # Scope
    scope = """
    The scope of the project includes three main aspects:
    1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the raw stock data into a usable format.
    2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key patterns, trends, and statistics 
       that describe the stock prices of the FAANG companies.
    3. Data Visualization: Creating informative visualizations such as time-series line 
       charts and other relevant graphical representations to better understand the stock 
       movements and price trends.
    """

    # Major Steps in the Procedure
    major_steps = """
    The procedure for conducting the analysis is broken down into the following major steps:
    
    1. **Data Acquisition:**
       - Download the dataset from Kaggle (FAANG Complete Stock Data). 
       - The dataset contains historical stock prices for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, 
         and Google.

    2. **Data Preprocessing:**
       - Load the data and ensure that it is clean and ready for analysis.
       - Handle missing values, convert date columns to datetime format, and remove unnecessary 
         data.
       - Filter the data to focus on stock price information (Open, Close, High, Low, Volume).

    3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
       - Calculate descriptive statistics for the stock prices, including mean, median, standard 
         deviation, etc.
       - Explore correlations between stock prices of the FAANG companies to see if there are 
         any interesting relationships.
       - Use time-series analysis techniques to observe patterns in stock prices over time.

    4. **Data Visualization:**
       - Visualize the stock prices over time using line charts or candlestick charts.
       - Create comparative visualizations to compare the stock performance of the FAANG companies.
       - Generate additional visualizations like correlation heatmaps to explore relationships 
         between stock prices.

    5. **Insight Generation and Conclusion:**
       - Draw conclusions from the visualizations and analysis.
       - Discuss any significant trends, anomalies, or correlations that emerge from the data.
